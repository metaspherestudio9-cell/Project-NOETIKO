# NOETIKO Tutorial

## Simulation Basics
1. Run `python3 simulations/resonance_calc.py`.
2. Observe the `Skin Depth` output. For 1.42 GHz, this must be precisely calibrated to the material's conductivity.

## Visualizing Results
Check the `/results` folder for generated TORUS geometry heatmaps after running the full simulation suite.
