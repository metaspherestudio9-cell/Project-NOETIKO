**Official Validation Framework for the NOETIKO Trilogy.**
This repository contains the core mathematical simulations and validation scripts for the **Genesis Protocol** and **Artifact_01**, focusing on the 1.42 GHz Hydrogen Line interaction.

> "Biology is not controlled by Energy. It is controlled by Information."

## 📡 Abstract
NOETIKO is a research initiative operationalizing the **1.42 GHz Hydrogen Hyperfine Transition** for biological entropy reduction. This framework validates the physical parameters required for the **Bifilar Möbius Emitter** to achieve resonance coupling with the Hydrogen Line ($H_1$).

## 🧬 Wellness Applications & Context
While this framework is rooted in rigorous physics, its primary application is in the field of **Information Hygiene** and **Entropy Reduction** for biological systems.

* **Coherence Optimization:** Simulating how specific frequencies (1.42 GHz) can minimize thermodynamic noise in cellular signaling.
* **Signal Processing:** Treating the biological organism as a high-fidelity receiver that requires calibration via the Vector Potential ($A$-Field).
