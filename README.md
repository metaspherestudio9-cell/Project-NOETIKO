## 📡 Abstract
NOETIKO is a research initiative operationalizing the **1.42 GHz Hydrogen Hyperfine Transition** for biological entropy reduction. This repository contains the core calculations for the **Artifact_01 (Bifilar Emitter)** to prove technical feasibility.

> "Biology is not controlled by Energy. It is controlled by Information."

## 📂 Repository Structure

### `/research`
Contains the core physics engine.
- **`resonance_calc.py`**: Python module determining the exact wire lengths and skin-depth parameters for 1.42 GHz resonance coupling.

### `/docs`
Documentation and legacy project notes.
- **`PROJECT_HISTORY.md`**: Archive of previous project states and internal notes.

## 🚀 Technical Validation
To audit the resonance parameters:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/noetiko-core.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/noetiko-core.git)

# Run the simulation engine
python3 research/resonance_calc.py
