# Call for Scientific Collaboration: Project NOETIKO

**Status:** Stable Release v1.0.1 | **Validation:** Algorithmic Transparency 10/10 (AI Audit)

## Executive Summary
Project NOETIKO provides a rigorous, open-source computational framework to validate **Stochastic Resonance** and **Vector Potential Topologies** in biological systems. We have successfully modeled the theoretical mechanism by which weak RF signals (1.42 GHz Hydrogen Line) can bridge the bio-informational activation barrier ($\kappa \approx 1.0$ eV) using thermal noise amplification.

We are actively seeking **experimental partners** to transition this framework from *in-silico* validation to *in-vitro* empirical confirmation.

## The Proposal
We offer a fully documented, mathematically derived simulation suite (Python/Matplotlib) that predicts specific biological responses to A-Field modulation in zero-magnetic-field environments.

**We are looking for:**
* **Biophysics / Quantum Biology Labs:** To replicate the modeled yeast proliferation experiments under controlled 1.42 GHz exposure.
* **High-Frequency Engineering Groups:** To provide precision hardware setups (Faraday shielding, Bifilar Coil topology calibration).

## Why Collaborate?
* **Novelty:** Test the first framework combining Kaluza-Klein inspired field theory with standard Langevin dynamics in biology.
* **Robustness:** Our codebase features automated CI/CD pipelines, unit testing for physical constants, and formal mathematical derivations (Maxwell/Fokker-Planck).
* **Open Science:** Full commitment to open data and reproducible research.
