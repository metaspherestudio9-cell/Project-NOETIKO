## Reporting a Vulnerability

Project NOETIKO is a scientific simulation framework. While it does not handle sensitive user data, we take code integrity seriously.

If you discover a vulnerability (e.g., in the PyTorch tensor implementation or input validation), please report it via:
* **Email:** [Dein-Kontakt-Email-oder-Issue-Tracker]
* **GitHub Issues:** Open an issue with the tag `security`.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours.
